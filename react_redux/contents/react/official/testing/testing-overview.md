## Two main category
* rendering component trees: unit + integration
* running complee app: end to end
    * can prevent regression
        * regression: when you develope new funciton which cause bug in old functions

* note: react official only focus on rendering component trees test


## Tradeoffs
* How much to mock:
    * [unit v.s integration](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/er1xk5/unit_testing_vs_integration_testing_in_react_js/)

## Tools
* Jest
    * test runner
    * create testing env and provide basic testing structure
* React Testing Library
    * test React components without relying on their implementation details
