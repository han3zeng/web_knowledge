# Why

## Webpack
* module, scope
* bundle - reduce number of request
    * reduce request overheads
        * ex: three way handshake
        * ex: TLS Negotiation
* code splitting




## Redux
* react problem
    * two components are in two different subtree and are almost at the leaf.
        * you have to put the state at common ancesstor and pass it down throuh a lot unrelated components
* single store to control all states
* uni-directional data flow

## Http2

## GraphQL

## Prisma

## Relay
* work with GraphQL
* use same component in multiple trees and the component listen to server state
* cache the server data, and only fetch changed part
