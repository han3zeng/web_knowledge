## why OAuth
* grant access to your account
    * ex: Twitter
        * you grant specific app to access your twitter account
        * the app ask your password directly

    * problems:
        * the app has your password which causes security flaw
            * vulnerable to harvesting passwords
            * if you want to revoke the access permission, you have to change you twitter password directly
